Doggie's World

The main purpose of this application is to offer a high level view of knowledge to people interested in dogs or people that want to know a little bit more about dogs by selecting a type of dog and learning about throughout web links that describe the type of food they should eat and in the future could learn more about dog's health like how many vaccines need to be applied depending of the breed, age and size. This could be done by using external links or through the use of APIs. In the future, Users should be able to login with the use of an ID and password.

When Users are using the ap, they can look at a selection of dogs and be able to select a dog by clicking on the dog's name. they can also add a dog, select an existing one and delete a dog. This is called a full CRUD functionality. Once they select a dog they can view selected facts for that particular dog like foods they should eat, (depending of the breed, age or size) and other interesting facts that will be added in future releases.
